# Mechanical Keyboard Sound Simulator

This project simulates the sound of a mechanical keyboard when you press keys on your actual keyboard. Each key press triggers a corresponding sound that replicates the sound of typing on a mechanical keyboard. The simulation is achieved using audio files and is intended to provide a more immersive typing experience.

## Features

- Provides an audio simulation of a mechanical keyboard while typing.
- Customizable audio configuration for different keys.
- Supports both letter and functional keys.
